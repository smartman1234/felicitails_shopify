About a year and a half ago I noticed she was starting to slow down. She was noticeably playing less and clearly thinking before she jumped and used steps. At her age arthritis is common and can be hard to manage as your best friend ages. Luckily my sister in-law, Molly Fulghom had started with Green Compass and suggested I try the pet CBD drops. I have to admit I was VERY apprehensive at first. I thought how could this possibly help and honestly thought it was a fad. She was persistent, so I did some research of my own to ensure I wasn’t going to cause harm. Shortly after we gave it a try, like Within DAYS...yes days she was noticeably upbeat and not as sore. She was acting like a 5 year old instead of a 15 year old. The results were unimaginable and quite frankly I couldn’t believe it myself since I was so skeptical at first.<\/p>",

I could see it made him overall feel better and not achy as the days I didn't give it to him, he seemed less mobile and more achy. Now I use the bacon flavor for my 5 yr old\/75# lab who suffers from anxiety due to the fear aggression she had when she was a pup. The first few days, I gave her 1ml once a day. I didn't really notice a difference, but then I was told to try and up the dosage. It's been 1 week, given 2 ml twice a day in her food and it has helped significantly! Her anxiety is minimal. She loves it so much, she won't eat her food without it. She will often even lick the dropper before I can get it on her food. This isn't something you give\/take \"once in a while\", it needs to be consistent or you won't notice a difference. Knowing that this works AND is good for my pets (who are my children and world), it's a win\/win and I no longer need to try other products.<\/p>",
