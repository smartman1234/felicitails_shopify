Everyone will branch out their new work in their branch that has been created.

Here are the current core branches:

dev-omar-errabaany
dev-alex-tellman
dev-iwo-wisniewski

When you create a deliverable assigned, you will create a new branch for that deliverable using the following:
(dev)-(date)-(function comment)

here is an example:
dev-alex-tellman-06-04-2023-insert-four-landing-pages-wag-partnership

NOTE: It is important that we also Tag our work so we can version control the evolution of the feature that we released. If you are simply adding a new feature to an existing feature it is 

Our Taging we will use are:

v1.0.1-develop
v1.0.1-release

For reference, we use Git to make use of both Git branches and Git tags. Branches allow you to code features or fix bugs without impacting the main code branch, whereas tags are essential for marking a point in time in your code, such as a new release of your application that is already in existence.

So as you will see that Alex made a branch and tagged it:

Branch:
dev-alex-tellman-06-04-2023-insert-four-landing-pages-wag-partnership

Tag:
v1.0.1-develop
v1.0.1-release

I will have two check points: the Release Point and I have a Visual server to preview in. At some point I will introduce peer review at the Develop phase but not for now as you will provide your own peer review.

When I approve, you will pull everything through to make a push into the Main branch which is production.

From there, you would sync the Main locally so you are fresh locally and then continue your work on the next task. 

Right now we are in the Brief, but I will start to move from the Brief to Git and use Projects for projects and Issues for fixes.

We simply continue on with this process over and over again.

NOTE: I will look into setting up Auto Merge, protecting the Main Branch, using SSH keys as we evolve our development environment, but for now this gets us straight and we are then not making all these files in Shopify, stepping on each other and developing in an agile manner.
